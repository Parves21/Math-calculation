        <h3 class="font-bold text-3xl"> What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
        <p class="text-2xl font-normal">Dom means Document Object Model. DOM is a platform and programming interface for
            web documents that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and
            style of a document. The general advantages of DOM include: Data persists in memory. You can go forwards and
            backwards in the tree (random access) You can make changes directly to the tree in memory.</p>

    <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold text-3xl">How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods?</h3>
        <p class="text-2xl font-normal">I think, there are five different methods in which users can access or
            manipulate HTML elements using
            JavaScript. They are, <br>
            1. HTML DOM getElementById() Method. <br>
            2. HTML DOM getElementsByClassName() Method. <br>
            3. HTML DOM getElementsByName() Method. <br>
            4. HTML DOM getElementsByTagName() Method. <br>
            5. HTML DOM querySelectorAll() Method. <br>
            6. HTML DOM querySelector() Method.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold text-3xl">What is event bubble?</h3>
        <p class="text-2xl font-normal">Event Bubbling is a concept in the Document Object Model. It happens when an
            element receives an event, and that event bubbles up to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree
            until it gets to the root element.</p>

    <div>
        <h3 class="font-bold text-3xl">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
        <p class="text-2xl font-normal">Callback function means an argument to another function. This technique allows a function to call another function. A callback function can run after another function has finished.Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.</p>
